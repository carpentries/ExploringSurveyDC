# ExploringSurveyDC

## Description
[Data Carpentry Survey Assesment](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment-projects) is a on going project that I signed up to help with on July 25th, 2017. I have joined [Kari L. Jordan](https://twitter.com/DrKariLJordan) and worked in producing visualizations of the pre and post surveys. You can read more about it in the [Carpentries repo](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment-projects). Note, I have not worked with data from Software carpentry survey, as that is a completed project.
